ReactJS is an open-source, component-based front-end library responsible only for the view layer of the application. It is maintained by Facebook.React uses a declarative paradigm that makes it easier to reason about your application and aims to be both efficient and flexible. It designs simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right component when your data changes. The declarative view makes your code more predictable and easier to debug.",
